{% include JB/setup %}


1. Test for the NV density of the new sample
2. Piranha clean to remove oil
3. ICP 30s to get a distinct surface peak (scanz) (program: diamond etch-1, O2 7/Ar 8, 120W/1000W)
4. evaporate Al 20nm 
5. Marker imprinting by FIB(fixed with Ag colloid, 110 °C bake 30min) (no 3-acid clean and ICP, markers will become difficult to distinguish after this operations)
6. remove Al (using S1805 developer)
7. NV location 
8. Piranha clean
9. evaporate Al 20nm 
10. SIL calculation and fabrication by FIB (fixed with Ag colloid, 110 °C bake 30min)
11. 3-acid clean to remove carbon
12. ICP etch 70nm(20s) to remove Ga+(Run the program for 30s) (program: diamond etch-1, O2 7/Ar 8, 120W/1000W)
13. Test for the efficiency
14. Piranha Clean
15. PMMA Spin-coating and baking (A4, 3 layers, 6000rpm, 90s, 180°C baking for 5min, 5min and 10min respectively, Temperature?) 
16. evaporate Al 20nm 
17. EBL, developing Lithography  (developing:  remove Al (using S1805 developer), DI water, N2, MIBK:IPA=1:3(PMMA developer)  1min, IPA  1min,  N2)
18. plasma clean (program: PMMA clean 6min)
19. What should we do afterwards? evaporate Ti60nm+Cr60nm+Au60nm
20. lift off: Soak in PG remover > 12h, then 85°C boil >30min, then lift off( u may not know how to do now)
21. fixed with cryogenic colloid, wire bonding
