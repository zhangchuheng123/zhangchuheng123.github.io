This is the sample log

* test: NV are on the depth of about 20um, no shallow NV 
* ICP long time (recipe: Ar/Cl2 160W 200W 30min * 12times real depth = 10.11um) follows piranha clean
* test: surface is a slope - unable to determine surface position; surface is dirty
* ICP (recipe: O2-7/Ar-8 normal) follows piranha clean
* test: surface is still bad (slope even broader), no NV in proper depth
* ICP (recipe: O2-7/Ar-8 normal) follows piranha clean
* test: the same as ICP before
* ICP (recipe: Ar/Cl2 200W 320W 1. 1h real_depth=2.5um 2. 2h real_depth=5.65um total_depth=8.58um) follows piranha clean
* Piranha, Evaporate Al 20nm
* adhere sample to stage by colloidal silver and bake 30min at 110°C
* FIB chipname and markers (700um*700um)
* remove Al and colloidal silver
* NV location (found 10)
* NV spectrum testing (Chang Xiuying)
