Silver colloid and Al should be cleaned after FIB

1. Prepare beakers: Acetone, IPA, S1803 developer, Di water
2. Put FIB stage with sample into acetone. Remove Sample from the stage with tweezers in the solution.
3. Ultrasound the sample in acetone. Use clean paper to remove silver colloid, two sides and four edges.
4. IPA rinse. Use tweezers to wash the sample in photoresist developer until the aluminium is removed.
